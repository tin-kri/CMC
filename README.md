Course Assignment Content Managment Systems

Goal

Use your knowledge of WordPress content management to setup an API for consumption in your cross-course project.
Brief

In this assignment, youâ€™ll be using the WordPress REST API to manage the products for a website. Instead of having the products hardcoded into the HTML, you will use JavaScript to fetch the list of WordPress products and display them on your site.

There are two distinct aspects to this assignment:

    Setup and configure a headless WordPress + WooCommerce API
    Fetch this API as a data source and display it as part of your cross-course project
